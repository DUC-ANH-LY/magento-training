Every Magento module has a version number that is stored in the module.xml file. When we
look in the database table setup_module, we see the version numbers of every module.
When running the command php bin/magento setup:upgrade, Magento will check, for
every module, the version number in the module.xml file and the database table setup_
module.
If a module is not in the list, the InstallData.php script will be executed. After that, the
UpgradeData.php script is always executed.
With an if statement, we can manage what things need to be executed in a specific upgrade.
